                    <p>Hello Grading Team and TAs please read.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was born and raise in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in a hard working loving family. While my
                        brothers followed my fathers
                        footsteps in software engineering I trekked to the mountains. Living in the mountains working jobs
                        that provided me with enough monetary needs to live freely.  It completed me until Covid-19 directed me onto a new path. 
                        I quickly adjusted my mindset to a panic in search of a stable career path that still provided the freedom that I need.
                        I threw myself back into the education system pursuing a multitude of degrees; Electrical Engineering, Writing, 
                        Product Design and Programming.  After nearly one whole year of personal self analytical judgment I learned 
                        that this bootcamp is the path I wish to put my entire heart into.  Rather than using it as a stepping stone I believe it is
                        a path that will full fill my personal needs.  This happened about a week ago haha. Rather than putting all my time and energy 
                        into calculous, chem-2 and all the maths I'm adusting my sail into this bootcamp. 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>When I'm not in school you'll find me outside exploring the mountains with my fiance and dogs in
                        our 4x4 adventure rig.
                        It is a goal of mine to equip the rig with mobile interenet acess so I can work remotley while
                        adventuring.
                        I've alway been a creator at heart and look forward to progressing this page as I continue to
                        learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm currently working on a completely new revamped page that is completely broken so I will be turning 
                        in this page as a supplement.   
                    </p>
