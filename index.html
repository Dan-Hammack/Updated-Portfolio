                    <p>Hello and welcome to my Portfolio. On this page you will learn a little bit about me, Dan
                        Hammack, what I've done and how to get in touch with me.
                        This page was created in my bootcamp for full stack web development at the University of Utah.
                        As a new junior
                        developer, I've already grown an inifity towards learning the world of digitial creation.
                    </p>
                    <p>I was born and raise in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in a hard working loving family. While my
                        brothers followed my fathers
                        footsteps in software engineering I trekked to the mountains. After years of working in the
                        restaurant industy exploring
                        mountain towns, Covid-19 directed me onto a new path. I'm currently enrolled in college
                        full-time completing a bachelors in product design as well
                        as an associates in electrical engineering. In order to make ends meet I've also taken on web
                        development as a new career to
                        help me reach my goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>When I'm not in school you'll find me outside exploring the mountains with my fiance and dogs in
                        our 4x4 adventure rig.
                        It is a goal of mine to equip the rig with mobile interenet acess so I can work remotley while
                        enojoying adventuring.
                        I've alway been a creator at heart and look forward to progressing this page as I continue to
                        learn.
